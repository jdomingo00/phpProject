#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)

Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated
source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:

* `line`: The line number in the generated source.  Line numbers in
  this library are 1-based (note that the underlying source map
  specification uses 0-based line numbers -- this library handles the

* `column`: The column number in the generated source.  Column numbers
  in this library are 0-based.

* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or
